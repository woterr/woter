        <p>
          I'm a 16-year-old highschool student aiming towards creating elegant
          sites on the net. I am passionate about creating visually appealing
          and functional designs that meet the needs of my clients. I enjoy the
          challenge of taking a client's vision and transforming it into a
          tangible design that exceeds their expectations. Although, more than
          considering web designing as a job, I consider it a hobby. Web
          designing is not about making websites look pretty, accessibility and
          user-experience tirumphs over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this, I stay up-to-date with the latest design trends, but
          the main theme being elegance. I am always on the lookout for new
          tools and resources that can help me create better designs and
          streamline my workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other designers, I charge my clients on various factors such as
          - number of pages, overall design time, functionality of the
          components, maintenance, and availability of content. When it comes to
          non-profit websites, I often design them for free as I believe that it
          is one step towards humanity and mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, as a designer, my goal is to create designs that not only
          look great but also solve problems and improve the user experience. I
          am committed to delivering high-quality work and building strong
          relationships with my clients based on trust and collaboration.
